# Football-Match-Prediction
The goal of this project is to develop a prediction system that can accurately predict whether a home team will win or not in a football match. We will use different machine learning algorithms—SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Naïve Bayes, LDA, QDA, and Neural Network—to develop our prediction system. We will use a dataset of past football matches with associated outcomes to train and test our models. The dataset contains various features such as the team names, the date of the match, the venue, and various statistics related to the teams and their players. We will preprocess the data and perform feature engineering to extract relevant features that can help us predict the outcome of a match. We will then train our models using the pre-processed data and evaluate their performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). We will also perform a statistical analysis to determine the significance of the results. The model with the best performance on the test dataset will be selected as the final model for our prediction system. The prediction system can be used by sports enthusiasts, fans, and gamblers to make informed decisions about placing bets on future football matches. Our prediction system can also be extended to other sports and used for various applications such as player selection, team composition, and strategy development.
